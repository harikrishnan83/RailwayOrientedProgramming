## Initial code

We start with this procedural code that is mainly using if-else to handle errors.

[Step 0: Procedural Code](src/main/kotlin/com/ropsample/arrow)

## Refactoring steps

### Solving the problem with Kotlin

[Step 1: Method Extraction](src/main/kotlin/com/ropsample/methodExtraction)

[Step 2: Lining up the functions](src/main/kotlin/com/ropsample/liningupthefunctions)

[Step 3: Railway Oriented Programming](src/main/kotlin/com/ropsample/railwayorientedprogramming)

### Using Arrow

[Step 4: Using Either And FlatMap](src/main/kotlin/com/ropsample/arrow)

[Step 5: Extracting error handling](src/main/kotlin/com/ropsample/arrowandinfix)
